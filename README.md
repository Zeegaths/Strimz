Built on the Polygon Amoy blockchain, Strimz leverages Chainlink automation to enhance efficiency and reliability in DeFi applications. 

By utilizing smart contracts, low transaction fees, and high throughput on Polygon Amoy, Strimz offers secure and efficient token streaming functionalities.

Strimz aims to elevate the user experience and operational efficiency within DeFi projects, providing seamless, uninterrupted transactions backed by the security and transparency of blockchain technology.

## Problem Statement

Many major subscription services lack crypto payment options, and employers seeking to pay salaries in crypto face challenges in loading addresses and automating payments.

## Solution

## Business Logic

Strimz targets onboarding existing web2 services offering subscriptions, such as DSTV, Starlink, and Netflix. We generate income by charging both companies and users for transactions made through the platform. As we scale, we plan to introduce custom subscriptions and premium plans to further increase our income.

Collaborations with partners and other products will help attract users and expand our client base. Future prospects include expanding to more custom subscription-based services and automated staking rewards.

## Implementation

Key tools used in the development of Strimz include:

- Chainlink automation using upkeep.
- Smart contracts developed with Solidity.
- Deployment on Polygon Amoy testnet.
- Frontend development with React and TypeScript.
